# Moravian Lives

This is the source code for the Moravian Lives project website (http://moravianlives.org/).

This project is in two parts:

* A Wordpress theme for the website
* A Backbone.js application for visualizing the map interface (http://moravianlives.org/map)

The map interface is displayed on the website as a part of the Wordpress theme using a special template "Map page" (moravian-memoirs/www/wp-content/themes/llportal/map-page.php).

The javascript program uses gulp. To initialize it type `npm install` to install dependencies and then `gulp` to start the build process.
